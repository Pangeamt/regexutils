-A general function which creates a matcher based on a user-passed dictionary (to be read from file)
and the name of the corresponding tag

-Extending the spacy name matcher:
    -Match full names in reversed order (last names first, then first names)
    -Match titles before names
    -Match patterns "Title lastname*"
    -Match sole first names or last names if a full name is found in the doc which contains it
     (and link them to original)=>better anonimisation and allows more complex cross-references
